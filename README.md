LoggingInterceptor
==================

Adding features to an existing iOS project? Can't figure out what screen belongs to what code? Let the App tell you!

Simply drag the LoggingInterceptor.m to your project, and whatever methods you are intererested in will emit a log message whever they execute.

Please read the class comment in the source code, or risk your app being rejected by the App Store - this code should not be in release builds.
